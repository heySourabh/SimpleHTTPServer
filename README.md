# SimpleHTTPServer
This is a simple http server to run and test webpages while designing webpages

### To run the server on the default port (8000) simply use the command:

`java -jar /dist/SimpleHTTPServer.jar`

### To runthe server on a specific port run the command:

`java -jar /dist/SimpleHTTPServer.jar <port>`

This will serve the page `./webpage/index.html` and use the folder `webpage` as the base folder for next upcoming requests.
